Arrow

This is a very simple arrow game I started in '98 and worked on
every once in a while. I just recently remembered it, and thought
the vb open source community might like it.

It doesn't use a very well developed event model because it was
originally developed in QBasic, which has no event model. :-)

I hate writing documentation for my programs, and I'm not all that
good at making them easily readable, but it shouldn't be too hard to
understand. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at
